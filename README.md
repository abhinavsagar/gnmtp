## Abstract

Drug discovery using deep learning has attracted a lot of attention of late as it
has obvious advantages like higher efficiency, less manual guessing and faster
process time. In this paper, we present a novel neural network for generating
small molecules similar to the ones in the training set. Our network consists of
an encoder made up of bi-GRU layers for converting the input samples to a latent
space, predictor for enhancing the capability of encoder made up of 1D-CNN
layers and a decoder comprised of uni-GRU layers for reconstructing the samples
from the latent space representation. Condition vector in latent space is used for
generating molecules with the desired properties. We present the loss functions
used for training our network, experimental details and property prediction metrics.
Our network outperforms previous methods using Molecular weight, LogP and
Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness as the evaluation metrics.

## Data

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](http://zinc.docking.org/).

A sample of 100,0000 SMILES strings of drug like molecules was randomly sampled from ZINC
database. We use 90,000 molecules for training and 10,000 molecules for testing the property
prediction performance. A special sequence indicating end of sequence is appended at the end of
every sequence. To evaluate the performance of our network, we used three properties molecular
weight (MolWt), Wildman Crippen partition coefficient (LogP) and quantitative estimation of druglikeness (QED).

## Usage

Calculate molecular properties:

`python calculate.py --input_filename=smiles.txt --output_filename=output.txt`

Train model:

`python train.py --prop_file=output.txt --save_dir=./save`

Generate molecules with desired properties (Example MW=300, LogP=4, and TPSA=100):

`python sample.py --prop_file=output.txt --save_file=save/model.ckpt --target_prop='300 4 100' --result_filename=result.txt`

## Benchmarks

The following benchmarks was used to determine the performance of our network for generating
molecules:

1. `Validity`: It assesses whether the molecules generated are realistic or not. Examples of not valid
molecules are one with wrong valency configuration or wrong SMILES syntax.

2. `Uniqueness`: It assesses whether the molecules generated are different from one another or not.

3. `Novelty`: It assesses whether the molecules generated are different from the ones in the training
set or not.

## Property Prediction

An important tool for evaluating the performance of network is done using properties distribution.
The following three properties are used:

1. `Molecular weight (MW)`: It is the sum of atomic weights in a molecule. To figure out if the
generated samples are biased towards lighter or heavier molecules histograms of molecular weight
for the generated and test sets are plotted.

2. `LogP`: It is the ratio of a chemical’s concentration in the octanol phase to its concentration in the
aqueous phase.

3. `Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness (QED)`: It is a measure of how likely a molecule is a
viable candidate for a drug. It’s value lies between 0 and 1 both included.
